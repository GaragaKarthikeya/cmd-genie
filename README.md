## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `wish` command is a Bash function that orchestrates the following steps:

1.  **Input**: You type `wish "your request"` in your terminal.
2.  **Backend Call**: The `wish` function calls the Python script `x_backend.py`, passing your request as an argument.
3.  **Dual AI Generation**: The backend sends two parallel requests to the Google Gemini API:
    *   **Command Generation**: A request with a `temperature` of `0.0` asks for a precise, executable Linux command.
    *   **Description Generation**: A second request with a `temperature` of `0.3` asks for a structured, educational explanation of the command.
4.  **Parsing and Display**: The Python script returns a structured description and the command to the Bash function. The `wish` function then:
    *   Formats the description with colors (e.g., for **Purpose**, **Flags**, and **Tip**).
    *   Displays the formatted explanation.
    *   Prints `Press ‚Üë to reveal` to the console.
    *   Uses `history -s` to inject the generated command into your shell's history.
5.  **Execution**: When you press the **Up Arrow** key, the command appears in your terminal, ready to be edited or executed by pressing **Enter**.

This dual-temperature approach ensures that commands are accurate and safe, while descriptions are educational and easy to understand.

## üíª Requirements

-   **Python 3.9+**: Required to run the backend script.
-   **Bash Shell**: The `wish` function is a Bash script.
-   **Google Gemini API Key**: Necessary for AI-powered command generation. You can get a free key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
-   **Internet Connection**: Required to communicate with the Gemini API.
-   **Color-Enabled Terminal**: Recommended for the best visual experience.

## üìö Educational Design

cmd-genie is designed to be more than just a utility; it's a learning tool.

-   **Dual-Temperature AI**: Commands are generated at `temperature = 0.0` for accuracy, while descriptions are generated at `temperature = 0.3` for clear, helpful explanations.
-   **Structured Learning**: The "Purpose, Flags, Tip" format is designed to teach you not just *what* a command does, but *how* it works.
-   **Clean and Clear**: The output is color-coded and formatted for readability, making it easy to quickly understand the command's function.

## üîß Development

If you want to contribute to or modify `cmd-genie`, here are some tips to get you started:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmd-genie
    cd cmd-genie
    ```
2.  **Set Up Your Environment**:
    *   Run `./install.sh` to install dependencies and set up the `wish` command.
    *   Make sure to set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as described in the **Installation** section.
3.  **Making Changes**:
    *   **Backend**: To test changes in the Python backend, you can run it directly:
        ```bash
        python3 x_backend.py "your query"
        ```
    *   **Frontend**: If you modify `x_function.sh`, you'll need to reload it in your current terminal session:
        ```bash
        source x_function.sh
        ```
    *   You can check if the function is loaded correctly with `type wish`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the behavior of `cmd-genie` by editing the `config.py` file. This file allows you to change:

-   **AI Settings**: Modify the `AI_MODEL` (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`), `TEMPERATURE` (for both commands and descriptions), and `MAX_TOKENS`.
-   **Colors**: Adjust the ANSI color codes in the `Colors` class to match your terminal's theme.
-   **Prompts**: Change the `COMMAND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `DESCRIPTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` to alter the AI's personality or output format.
-   **Feature Flags**: Toggle features on or off:
    - `ENABLE_COLORS`: Enable or disable colored output.
    - `ENABLE_MARKDOWN`: Control the structured "Purpose/Flags/Tip" formatting.
    - `ENABLE_SAFETY_CHECKS`: Toggle the dangerous command blocking feature.
    - `ENABLE_COMMAND_HISTORY`: Control whether commands are saved to your shell history.
